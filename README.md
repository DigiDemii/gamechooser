# gamechooser

A solo project where I play around using Flask.
This is my first Flask project and is a little app that cycles through a list of games from my gaming backlog and tells me which one to play.
Each time the page is refreshed, a new game will appear on the screen.

Commit #1 (01/02/22)

- Basic layout of the app
- A database with all of my games from my game backlog
